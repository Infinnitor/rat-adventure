I thank you for your generosity, stranger.
You… cannot possibly know how much this means to me.
I’ve never been chosen for anything, you see.
Always last to be picked for the basketball team in school.
Never the one who receive a call back on my audition.
Forever single on Valentine’s day…
I had a dream about it, actually.
About the feeling of loneliness.
I dreamt I was a frozen delicacy,
patiently awaiting the day I would be withdrawn from the fridge...
...and shared among a grateful, hungry family.
My expiration date was drawing near, so I knew my time must be soon.
Suddenly, the door opens;
the light goes on.
I can see the children in the back, eagerly badgering their father for supper.
Their mother tends to them, calming and seating them.
The father peers in, obscuring my view of the rest of the family.
His eyes fixate on me, and for a moment, it feels as if time is standing still…
but the moment is fleeting.
The father’s eyes dart around the fridge some more,
finally settling for a frozen carbonara meal from Marks and Spencer.
The fridge door closes, and the lights go out.
It’s dark.
It’s cold.
It’s lonely.
But none of that is comparable to the pit I feel deep within me
the ephemeral presence and subsequent absence of connection…
I’m very sorry, I do believe I’ve lost the plot a bit.
haha.
It’s been a while since anyone has allowed me to be so candid with them…
Except, you didn’t ask me to do that, did you?
You simply gave me a block of cheese.
A block of cheese which I appreciate,
but which ultimately bears no significance in quantifying our kinship.
I was simply a variable on a list,
a sector on the lottery wheel.
I’m just a number to you.
And you’ve probably spent this time wishing you threw your cheese to another rat,
a rat who has no understanding of the hardships borne by others less fortunate than they.
But I do understand. For I have borne many hardships, and shall bear many more.
This cheese does not change any of that - it simply provides me with a distraction,
a transient feeling of relief
which will undoubtedly be eclipsed by the realisation that I am still very much alone.
Just as in my dream.
I suppose there is no escape from that which emanates from within.
